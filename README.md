  User stories assist in interpreting user needs and implementing them into valuable products. They do so by grouping the needs of a customer into sections. Each user story will be developed according to its priority on the product backlog. Clear testing measures can be established while using user stories. These elements ensure that the customer plays an active role in the software development lifecycle.
  When approaching a software development project, it is important to establish a clear set of goals towards the funcationality and features of a program. I hope to incorporate daily scrum meetings in my future development work. Doing so will help me establish consensus between all involved parties. 
  To be a good team member in a software development team requires effective communication. Treating others with respect and assisting others enables teams to reduce the effort that a task requires. The scrum-agile framework is very beneficial towards effective communication and development practices.
